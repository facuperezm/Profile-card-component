## What I learned

I am still learning how to position components using Flexbox, and how position absolute will attach images to certain places of the parent component plus I am learning the importance of accessibility on web development projects.

### Continued development

In this project my goal was to keep learning my HTML and CSS skills, I'm learning on positioning images with position absolute and relative.
